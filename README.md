Title: Effectiveness of Tree-Based Models in Predicting Student Success<br>

Abstract: This analysis focuses on the usage of tree-based models to predict higher-education student success. The data used in this analysis will be a 2019 study of Cyprian engineering and educational sciences students, which has been gathered specifically to be used with machine learning techniques to predict end-of-term performances. The dataset features 31 predictors that fall into three categories: personal information (e.g., age, sex, relationship status, etc.), family information (e.g., parentsâ€™ education and occupation, number of siblings, etc.), and educational habits (e.g., study hours, type of exam prep, classroom behaviors, etc.). In addition, the dataset has been split into training and testing sets and tree-based models will be evaluated based on their abilities to predict final student grades. During this evaluation, a brief analysis of predictors from the dataset that contribute most to classification will be conducted.<br>
